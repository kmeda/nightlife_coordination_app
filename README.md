# nightlife_coordination_app

Freecodecamp Backend Project

This project requires that a user can search for local bars and RSVP ahead of time.

The app fetches data from yelp.

User login is required to RSVP.
User count for a bar is updated in realtime across all clients.
When a user logs back in, recent search is automatically loaded.
